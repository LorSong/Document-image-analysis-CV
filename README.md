Work description.
Global goal of this work is to create efficient pipelines for processing textual images. These pipelines will perform:

*   Image preprocessing
*   Text detection
*   Text recognition
*   Stamp recognition
*   And potentially more

First part:
 - Exploratory work on textual image recognition. 

  
  ** 1_Load_Process_Experiments
    In this notebook I'm preparing data for tf.data API and trying simple approaches to preprocess images.


Datasets used in this work
* DDI-100 dataset
